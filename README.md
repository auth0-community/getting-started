Welcome to our intro space 👋 This is your place to go to get some hands-on tips on how to make our mutual contribution experience to Auth0 Community repos the best out there! We strongly believe in power of open source software, that's why we're putting together this repo to make your contributions and our collaboration as smooth as possible 🤝 As we're always in the process of improving, there will be gradual changes implemented to this repo as well as auth0-community contributing experience in general. Keep your fingers crossed and watch out for facilitations 🤞🏼

### 👋 Intro

To begin with, we need to get to know a few terms and concepts so as to avoid misunderstanding while co-operating and communicating in the future:

* **Community repo:** a repo that belongs to auth0-community GitHub organisation
* **Community contributor / developer:** someone who contributes to community repos via code, docs improvements, PRs / issues discussion
* **Community admins:** Auth0 Community Team members

As we're growing our OSS community we'd like you to gradually take more and more control over those repos and become community admins as well. We're working hard on making your experience in auth0-community repos better day by day, so watch out for future engagements!

### 🦶 First Steps

Before making your first contribution to any of our repos, we highly recommend checking following files:

* [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/auth0-community/getting-started/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/auth0-community/getting-started/blob/master/CONTRIBUTION.md)
* [License](https://github.com/auth0-community/getting-started/blob/master/LICENSE)

that apply to each of our repos and will give you some insight on how to do stuff and stuff that is not allowed in here. We designed it having your best contributor experience in mind!

### 👮 Permissions and rights

You can find **all permissions, rights and dont-do things in [contributing guideline](https://github.com/auth0-community/getting-started/blob/master/CONTRIBUTION.md)** as well as in our **[code of conduct](https://github.com/auth0-community/getting-started/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).**

We strongly believe that those two documents will evolve over time so as to fulfill our community needs even better as our community grows and gets more experienced and mature. We want to keep all our efforts transparent, that's why we're always open for your feedback! You can submit it either with an issue or simply by contacting us at community@auth0.com.

### 📠 Syncing and communicating

We'd really love to have our collaboration flourish on all grounds and we think that establishing some processes around syncing and communicating are crucial to this. We'd like to introduce Slack guest channels or even host monthly webinars for community contributors at some point for the purpose of regular syncs and we're currently evaluating those options but for now we want to use following tools to make most out of our communication:

* **PRs' comments**: PRs-related discussions
* **Issues' comments**: Issues-related discussions
* **[Community Forum Open Source Category](https://community.auth0.com/c/open-source)**: Anything that you'd like to touch related to specific repos

In the last one you can find threads for each auth0-community GitHub org repo. As everyone is time-constraint and we do sometimes have limited bandwidth we want everyone to make their contribution toward discussing, reviewing and solving/merging issues and PRs! We're all in this together! 🤜🏼🤛🏻

### 🏆 Community Contributors Reward System

Currently in planning. Stay tuned! 🤟🏼
